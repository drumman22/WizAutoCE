I got tired of opening/closing cheat engine when playing wizard101 so made this.

Pretty easy setup for anyone, just run the .ahk script or the compiled executable. 

- Automatically opens and closes cheat engine
- Provides a (optional) simple auto injector/open script for cheat engine
- Hotkey (MouseButton4) for interacting with NPCs/Items

Any other hotkeys using cheat engine should be setup on that program seperately.
