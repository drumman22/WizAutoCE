I got tired of opening/closing cheat engine when playing wizard101 so made this.

Pretty easy setup for anyone, just run the .ahk script or the compiled executable. Also asks if you want to add an auto-injector/auto-open script for wizard101 when cheat engine opens
Provides one hotkey for talking to NPC's using mouse button 4. Any other hotkeys using cheat engine should be setup on that program seperately.
