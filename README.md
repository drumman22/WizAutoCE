I got tired of opening/closing cheat engine when playing wizard101 so made this.

Pretty easy setup for anyone, just run the .ahk script or the compiled executable. 

- Hotkey (MouseButton4) for interacting with NPCs
- Automatically opens and closes cheat engine
- Provides a (optional) simple auto injector/open script on launch

Any other hotkeys using cheat engine should be setup on that program seperately.
